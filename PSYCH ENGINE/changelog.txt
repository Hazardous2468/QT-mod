This is the final update for QT.
It was fun coming back but I'm going tired of working on QT so I don't want to continue updating this mod anymore. This isn't the last you'll see of me however, for I still have plans for the Inhuman mod.
Feel free to join my Discord for updates regarding that.
Thanks for playing and loving the QT mod!
